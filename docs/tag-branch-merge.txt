Here my advancement in git get starts 

# git tag ->

the git tag command is used to add a marker on a specific commit. The tag does not move around as new commits are added.

          - add a tag to the most recent commit
  	  - add a tag to a specific commit if a SHA is passed

# git branch ->

the git branch command is used to manage branches in Git

This command is used to:
   - list out local branches
   - create new branches
   - remove branches

# git merge ->

combining various branches together(as per need) in git is known as merging.
generally there two type of merge:
    - fast forward merge :- the branch being merged in must be ahead of the checked out branch. The checked out branch's pointer will just be moved forward to point to the same commit as the other branch.
    - the regular type of merge :- two divergent branches are combined and a merge commit is created
