now introducing a new commands 

# git show :

The git show command will show only one commit. So don't get alarmed when you can't find any other commits - it only shows one. The output of the git show command is exactly the same as the git log -p command.

So by default, git show displays:

*the commit
*the author
*the date
*the commit message
*the patch information
