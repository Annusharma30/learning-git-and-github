# Git Journey

Welcome to your Git journey! In this guide, we'll cover the basics of Git commands and how to effectively manage your repositories.

## Initialization and Creating a Repository

To start using Git for a project, you first need to initialize a new Git repository. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
git init
```

## Pushing Changes

Once you've made changes to your files and want to save them to your repository, you'll use the `git add` and `git commit` commands:

```bash
git add [files] or git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

## Viewing Repository Status and History

To see the status of your repository and view its commit history, you can use the following commands:

```bash
git log - used to view the entire commit history 
git status - used to check the state of the staging area and the working directory
```

Remember to use `git log` and `git status` regularly to stay updated on your repository's status.

## Fetching and Pulling Changes

To download existing code from a remote repository or pull down updates, you can use:

```bash
git clone - used to download existing code from a remote repository
git pull <remote> <branch> - used to pull down updates from the remote repository
git fetch - ...
```

## Exploring Commits and Differences

You can explore commits and differences using `git log` with various flags and the `git diff` command:

```bash
git log --oneline
git log --stat
git log -p
git log -w
git log --decorate
git diff
```

## Viewing Individual Commits

To view details about individual commits, you can use the `git show` command:

```bash
git show
```

## Tagging Commits and Managing Branches

You can tag specific commits and manage branches using `git tag` and `git branch` commands:

```bash
git tag - used to add a marker on a specific commit
git branch - used to manage branches in Git
```

## Merging Branches

To combine branches together, you can use the `git merge` command:

```bash
git merge - used to merge branches
```

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts during merging, you'll need to resolve them manually. 

Now, let's embark on your Git journey and start using these commands to manage your repositories effectively!
